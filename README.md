# Quick start for building a Firely Server Facade

[Firely Server](http://fire.ly/vonk) can be used as a FHIR interface to your own data store. To make this happen, you can implement the two interfaces that let the server communicate with the data store.

This project contains an example on how to do this for a fictional relational database. It is meant to accompany the exercise on how to build a Firely Server Facade on the [Firely Server documentation](http://docs.fire.ly/firelyserver/facade/facade.html).

## Get Firely Server

Your implementation of a facade runs as a plugin to Firely Server. Check the [Getting Started](http://docs.fire.ly/firelyserver/start.html) on how to obtain the binaries and an evaluation license.
